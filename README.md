# Obsidian-CTF-Template
A simple python3 script that automates the task of creating the basic files and directories used in Hacking CTFs for Obsidian. It eliminates the time-consuming process of creating these files and folders yourself!

NOTE: "thm", "htb", and "pg" directories will need to be in the same directory as the python script!
